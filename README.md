# CastAudio

CastAudio is a simple command-line tool that allows you to cast audio files to Google Cast devices on your local network.

## Features

- Automatically discovers Google Cast devices on the local network
- Hosts the audio file on a temporary HTTP server
- Casts the audio to the discovered device

## Prerequisites

- Go 1.x or higher
- A Google Cast-compatible device on your local network

## Installation

You can install CastAudio using Go's package manager:

```
go install github.com/philippta/castaudio@latest
```

This command will download the latest version of CastAudio and install it in your `$GOPATH/bin` directory. Make sure this directory is in your system's `PATH` to run CastAudio from anywhere.

## Usage

Run the program with the path to the audio file you want to cast:

```
castaudio /path/to/your/audiofile.mp3
```

The program will automatically discover a Google Cast device on your network and start playing the audio.

## How It Works

1. The program hosts the specified audio file on a temporary HTTP server.
2. It uses mDNS to discover Google Cast devices on the local network.
3. Once a device is found, it uses the `gochromecast` library to connect to the device and start playback.

## Why

The idea for CastAudio came from a desire to simplify the process of playing audio announcements on smart home devices. Here's the journey that led to its creation:

1. Initially, I tried to make my Alexa device announce something. However, the setup process was quite tedious:
   - It required creating and managing AWS accounts
   - Setting up AWS Lambda functions
   - Navigating through complex configurations
   - I never really got it working

2. This complexity seemed unnecessary for such a simple task.

3. Then, I discovered that a Google Home device (which I also had at home) could accomplish the same task much more easily:
   - No need for external accounts or cloud services
   - Works by simply sending an audio cast instruction on the local network
   - Eliminates the need for all the Alexa and AWS account complications

4. This realization led to the creation of CastAudio - a straightforward tool that leverages the simplicity of Google Cast devices to play audio announcements or files without any cumbersome setup.

CastAudio aims to provide a user-friendly, efficient way to interact with your Google Cast devices for audio playback, making it easy for anyone to send audio to their smart speakers with minimal fuss.
